# CIBMTR---Equity-in-post-HCT-Survival-Predictions

In this competition, I developed models to improve the prediction of transplant survival rates for patients undergoing allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) â€” which is an important step in ensuring that every patient has a fair chance at a successful outcome, regardless of their background.
This competition aims to encourage participants to advance predictive modeling by ensuring that survival predictions are both precise and fair for patients across diverse groups.
